// Linear Search

Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found,
otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set. It is the easiest searching algorithm

Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50,110, 100, 130, 170}, x = 110;
Output: 6
Explanation: Element x is present at index 6

Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50,110, 100, 130, 170}, x = 175;
Output: -1
Explanation: Element x is not present in arr[].

Follow the given steps to solve the problem:

Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
If x matches with an element, return the index.
If x doesn’t match with any of the elements, return -1.

// code
// C++ code to linearly search x in arr[]. If x
// is present then return its location, otherwise
// return -1

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int search(int arr[], int N, int x)
{
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
		if (arr[i] == x)
			return i;
	return -1;
}

int main(void)
{
	int arr[] = { 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 };
	int x = 10;
	int N = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);


	int result = search(arr, N, x);
	(result == -1)
		? cout << "Element is not present in array"
		: cout << "Element is present at index " << result;
	return 0;
}
